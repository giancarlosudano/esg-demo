### 1. Summary

```
Generali Real Estate SGR (hereinafter “GRE SGR”) considers principal adverse impacts of its investment
decisions on sustainability factors. The present statement is the consolidated statement on principal adverse
impacts on sustainability factors of GRE SGR. This document explains GRE SGR approach on the “Principal
Adverse Impacts of investment decisions on sustainability factors”.
```
```
This statement on principal adverse impacts on sustainability factors covers the reference period from 1st
January to 31st December 2022.
```
```
Monitoring activities and planned actions to mitigate the potential damage caused by climate change, waste
or misuse of natural resources (such as fossil fuels), as well as the active engagement with the stakeholders
involved in various aspects of all business-related activities and the exclusion of companies/ counterparties
pursuing not ethical behaviors are expected to decrease the principal adverse sustainability impacts
identified by GRE SGR.
```
```
Since GRE SGR focuses its business on managing Real Estate investments, the principal adverse
sustainability impacts (hereinafter “PAIs”) that are identified are the most critical and relevant for the
management of physical assets i.e., climate change and natural disasters, pollution, water and waste, risk
of involvement in ethical violations (e.g., human rights, corruption, compliance with laws).
GRE SGR considers PAIs as part of the business-as-usual and running operations, as GRE SGR has
committed to embedding ESG throughout daily work through the implementation of tangible actions aimed
to (i) improve the environmental impact created by underlying real estate assets (ii) further enhance the
impact of social welfare of our stakeholders through a long-term investment management strategy of our
real estate underlying assets, also through a transparent and efficient governance system.
```
```
It is essential for GRE SGR to adopt an effective and market-leading long-term fund strategy to attract and
retain investors. As the demand for sustainable products and sustainable work ethic within the real estate
sector is increasing, GRE SGR takes a proactive approach to establish the ESG credentials of its funds,
ensure to have a multi-year outlook and advocate our sustainability management to reflect our beliefs,
market’s needs and regulatory requirements. GRE SGR ambition is to continuously improve its sustainability
framework and of the funds/assets managed through integrating a series of tangible actions.
```
```
GRE SGR complies with art. 4 of the SFDR since March 2021 (please refer to http://www.generalirealestate.com
for further details), in order to provide investors and stakeholders in general a transparent disclosure on the
way PAIs are identified, measured, monitored and reduced/ minimized over time within our portfolio under
management.
```
```
For the final purpose of ensuring its investors the maximum level of commitment in transparency, GRE SGR
drafted this PAI Statement according to the requirements of the Regulatory Technical Standards (“RTS”)
adopted by the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288, including quantitative indicators respect to the PAIs
for the reporting period 2022.
```

Pursuant to the mentioned provisions, this PAI Statement takes into due account the specificity of the Real
Estate investment management business, the nature and scale of the activities of GRE SGR and the types
of financial products/ assets under management.

Consistently with the above, the list of PAIs used to assess GRE SGR’s portfolio impact includes the
following PAIs:

- Exposure to fossil fuels through real estate assets (share of investments in real estate assets
    involved in the extraction, storage, transport or manufacture of fossil fuels) (Table 1);
- Exposure to energy-inefficient real estate assets (share of investments in energy-inefficient real
    estate assets) (Table 1);
- GHG Emissions (Table 2);
- Energy consumption intensity (Table 2);
- Certified Buildings (additional proprietary indicator).

There are no applicable indicators for Real Estate investments provided in Annex I, Table 3 as referred to
in Article 6(1), point (b), in the format in Table 3 of Annex I Delegated Regulation adopting the RTS.
Furthermore, GRE SGR assessed the Table 3 indicators as not relevant for its investments.

The PAI statement refers to the GRE SGR portfolio, considering funds set-up and directly managed by GRE
SGR, including the direct investments (funds managed by GRE SGR), the indirect investments (funds of
funds managed by GRE SGR) and real estate debt investments (i.e., CRE debt funds).

About 90% of the total AuM, refers to funds for which GRE SGR has operational control at real estate asset
level. The remaining of the investment portfolio refers to indirect investments and real estate debt
investments for which GRE SGR does not have operational control at real estate asset level.

The methodological approach for the purpose of KPI calculation follows the references cited in the Annex I
of the RTS adopted by the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288 and any methodological assumption and
estimation adopted has been appropriately disclosed in the “Explanation” column of the table below and
explained in the Section “Description of policies to identify and prioritize principal adverse impacts on
sustainability factors”. In the context of the direct portfolio (i.e., properties managed at real estate level by
GRE SPA), GRE SPA serves as the data provider by collecting data/ information on the underlying real
estate assets. For the indirect and commercial real estate portfolios, the operational management of the
properties is delegated to third-party managers, thereby resulting in distinct methodologies being employed.

## 2. Description of the principal adverse impacts on sustainability factors

Based on the impact figures also the actions planned could be updated.
The adverse sustainability indicators in Table 1 of Annex I that are not listed in the table below are
considered “Not Applicable” to investments in real estate assets

### Description of policies to identify and prioritize principal adverse impacts on sustainability

### factors

Investment choices can have a potential adverse impact on stakeholders, environment and society.
GRE SGR believes that climate change, also given the peculiarities of the real estate asset class, is one of
the most relevant topics regarding the impacts of its investment choices.
As an investment manager, GRE SGR can mainly have a significant effect by:

- further reducing the investments in underlying real estate assets not reaching certain environmental
    labels or consumptions thresholds;
- further increasing the fund and asset management efforts towards initiatives and projects aimed at
    increasing the environmental performance of the buildings;
- sensitizing the tenants’ behaviors as ultimate users of the assets and, thus, responsible for the daily
    energy.

On the 27 th of April 20 23, the Board of Directors of GRE SGR approved the _“Sustainability Policy”_ and
_“Adverse Sustainability Impact Statement”_.
The Board of Directors is responsible of the approval and review of the Sustainability Policy and the "
_Adverse Sustainability Impact Statement”_ upon proposal of the CEO. The CEO is involved, inter alia, in
presenting to the Board of Directors the Sustainability Policy to be approved and is also in charge of the
implementation of such Policy with the support of the GRE SGR ESG function directly reporting to the GRE


```
SGR CEO. On an annual basis, the Board assesses and reviews the underlying methodology and the
outcomes of the implementation of the Policy.
The Board of Directors is also involved in the approval of this PAI Statement 2022, scheduled for June 23,
2023.
```
```
Based on the above, GRE SGR has decided to assess its impacts on sustainability factors through different
methodologies, criteria and tools, described below.
```
```
Sustainable due diligence
Acquisitions^1 undergo environmental/ sustainable due diligence (GRESA - Generali real estate suitability
assessment) that is performed by GRE SPA with regards to the funds set-up and the directly managed funds
by GRE SGR, excluding indirect funds and CRE debt investments.
Our proprietary Sustainable Assessment tool measures the weighted performance of each building
according to a series of dimensions such^2 as:
o Energy
o Water
o Waste
o Materials
o Land Use & Ecology
o Pollution
o Transport
o Health & Wellbeing
o Management
```
```
The outputs of these checks are embedded in the due diligence for informational purposes and for
consideration alongside other factors in the investment decision making process.
```
```
The Sustainable Due Diligence for Debt investments is subject to an ESG Scorecard, which provides an
overall ESG score for each Loan, based on indicators weighted on materiality and contribution to the SDGs.
The ESG Scorecard is also used to assess the ESG profile of the project Sponsor. ESG Scorecard uses a
number of indicators at asset and Sponsor level which may evolve over time and be adapted to industry
developments (e.g. availability of a Sustainable Building Certification, eco-efficiency and refurbishment,
tenant health and safety, and well-being, labor rights and working conditions, controversy assessment and
governance processes).
```
```
Data analytics
GRE SGR through GRE SPA is implementing a Data Analytics project covering most of European countries.
Existing utilities consumption data are collected and centralized in a digital platform, which automatically
calculates/ estimates CO 2 emissions and monitors their evolution, also supported by an innovative prop-
tech, green-tech software as a service solution.
```
```
Green Leases
GRE SGR through GRE SPA is proposing a new “Standard Green Lease Clause”, each time a lease with a
tenant is negotiated or renegotiated. This clause will allow to obtain at minimum the tenants’ utility
consumptions on a regular basis, so that GRE, on behalf of GRE SGR, can measure and take action to
improve its management, its buildings and the CO₂ footprint, in close collaboration with the tenants. Through
Green Lease, GRE SGR considers other selected ESG aspects by:
```
(^1) Without prejudice to the commitment to carry out sustainable due diligence for all potential investments, there may be reasons in case
it is not possible to run the sustainable due diligence (e.g., unavailability of information in relation to the timing of the property subject to
investment, inability to receive certain information on the property). In the event of the impossibility of carrying out sustainable due
diligence, a reasoned information will be provided.
(^2) Please note that dimensions/ areas of analysis are illustrative, they can be different depending on the type of asset under scrutiny and
given the evolution of the ESG market the Sustainable Due Diligence methodology might be modified and updated with different
dimensions/ area of analysis.


- Framing the relations of the parties to achieve compliance with the obligations prescribed by the
    regulations in force but also to embark the two parties on common and voluntary ESG commitments;
- Support the occupants of rented premises so that their use maintains or improves environmental
    quality by promoting productivity, the health and well-being, saving energy and natural resources
    and respecting the environment;
- Dialogue between the landlord and the tenant for a common environmental management of assets
    that create transparent exchanges about energy optimization and environmental actions.

```
Physical and transitional risk analysis
GRE SGR, through GRE SPA, carried out the first impact analysis for its full portfolio in 2020. Thanks to the
methodology developed by a specialized and market leader service provider for the potential estimation of
climate risk using a model - the "Climate VaR"^3 , GRE SGR has been able to geo-localize all its assets and
to map out the physical risks related to global warming.
A list of key hazard types has been assessed under climate change IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change) scenarios. As of today, the list of key hazards is the following:
o Water stress
o Wildfire
o Flood
o Heatwave
o Cold wave
o Hurricane
o Sea level rise
```
```
The outputs of this analysis are used to fulfil oversight duty on investments and related investment decision
making considerations.
```
```
Transition to a low-carbon economy
GRE SGR voluntarily pledges the reduction of portfolios’ emissions and - more broadly, the low-carbon
transition. GRE developed a proprietary methodology to assess and improve portfolios climate sensitivity by
(i) identifying climate leaders and laggards and (ii) optimizing portfolios according to various climate
strategies, as recommended by market best practice. As a tangible expression of this commitment, the
Generali Group joined the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance, a coalition of some of the world's leading asset
owners, convened by the United Nations, delivering on a bold commitment to make their investment
portfolios – including real estate - climate-neutral by 2050.
Moreover, GRE is currently using a tool aimed to estimate the impact of transition risk. The tool, developed
by a leader in the data provider’s industry, represents one of the few tools currently available on the market
for measuring / quantifying / estimating climate-related risks and defining any opportunities for an investment
portfolio. It is expected that, given the complexity of a climate risk quantification process / model, the results
that will come from the implementation of the tool itself will be taken into consideration as indicative and
preliminary estimates to be refined over the next few years as the market will develop more reliable models.
```
```
Counterparties screening
GRE SGR, through its service provider GRE SPA, considers the following controversies and/or business
sectors as relevant in the ESG assessment:
```
- Involvement in controversies which potentially infringe the principles of United Nation Global Compact:
    o companies involved in serious or systematic human rights and/or labour rights violations;
    o companies involved in severe environmental damages;
    o companies implicated in cases of gross corruption and bribery.
- Involvement in controversial business sectors:

(^3) The Climate Value-at-Risk (“Climate VaR”) is a model, made available by an international data provider, which provides an estimate of
climate physical and transition risk. The tool makes it possible to measure climate-related risks and define any opportunities for an
investment portfolio. Given the complexity of the model, the results of the implementation of the Climate VaR will be taken into
consideration as a rough and preliminary estimate to be refined over the next years, together with the development of more reliable
models.


o armament and weapons that violate fundamental humanitarian principles through their normal
use (cluster bombs, antipersonnel landmines, nuclear weapons, biological and chemical
weapons);
o coal.
The screening takes place on counterparties defined as buyer, seller of co-investors.

Control and check are based on the analysis of several dimensions in case the counterparty is deemed,
according to GRE SPA analysis, to be characterized by poor ESG practices on the above-mentioned
dimensions, the business opportunity is aborted.

The methodological approach adopted for the selection and prioritization of PAIs considers the specificity of
the Real Estate investment management business, the nature and scale of the activities of GRE SGR and
the types of financial products/ assets under management.

In accordance with Tables 1 and 2 of Annex 1 of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288 and consistent
with the availability and relevance of the required data, the following PAIs were selected:

- KPI 17 - Exposure to fossil fuels through real estate assets (share of investments in real estate assets
involved in the extraction, storage, transport or manufacture of fossil fuels) (Table 1);
- KPI 18 - Exposure to energy-inefficient real estate assets (share of investments in energy-inefficient
real estate assets) (Table 1);
- KPI 18 - GHG Emissions (Table 2);
- KPI 19 - Energy consumption intensity (Table 2);
- Certified Buildings (additional proprietary indicator).

GRE SGR takes into consideration the probability, the severity, and the potentially irremediable character
of the PAIs considered through a proprietary methodology based on a qualitative scale.
The prioritization of PAIs has been established through a matrix that takes into account the probability and
severity of these major negative effects, including their potentially irreparable nature, as required by Article
7 "RTS." The prioritization of each PAI is determined by the value (ranging from 1 to 3) calculated through
the arithmetic mean of the scores assigned to each of the aforementioned characteristics (severity,
probability, and irreparability) in accordance with the professional judgment of GRE SGR.
Specifically, the evaluations concerning the characteristics of the negative effects have taken into
consideration the potential magnitude of the adverse impact in the specific case of GRE SGR as well as the
commitment demonstrated in adhering to international standards and initiatives. For this reason, the
considered PAIs have a homogeneous priority.

Methodology & approach for the PAIs calculation
General approach
The approach implemented by GRE SGR, in relation to the disclosed KPIs, has included the following
considerations and assumptions:

```
TABLE 1 – KPI 17: Exposure to fossil fuels through real estate assets
```
- Assets under construction, under refurbishment or vacant are considered as “non-exposure to
    the fossil fuels sector”.
- The observation of the assets’ underlying activities led to the identification of a petrol station
    within a shopping center. However, the lease of the business accounts for less than 0,1% of the
    total leases of the asset and therefore the total exposure to fossil fuels (based on the underlying
    activities rent rate over the total rent of the assets) of the portfolio represents a non-significant
    exposure equivalent to 0,005%.
- For direct investments the exposure is observed based on the primary intended use of the assets,
    while for indirect equity / CRE debt information is requested from Fund Managers / Project
    Sponsor.

```
TABLE 1 – KPI 18: Exposure to energy-inefficient real estate assets
```

- Buildings that fall under other jurisdictions than the European Union are not required to abide by
    EPC and NZEB rules defined by EPBD (Energy Performance of Buildings Directives). This
    approach mainly concerns the indirect equity portfolio located in Asia and Oceania.
- For direct investments, actual information is directly collected and, when not available, estimated
    using GRE proprietary methodology (described in the next section) based on national regulatory
    frameworks, statistics and scenario analysis. For indirect investment/ CRE debt information is
    requested from Fund Managers / Project Sponsor.

```
GRE Proprietary methodology and assumptions for Table 1 – KPI 18: Exposure to energy-inefficient real
estate assets
GRE SGR and GRE SPA, for the purpose of “TABLE 1 – KPI 18: Exposure to energy-inefficient real estate
assets” calculation, developed a proprietary methodology to estimate the energy efficiency of assets for
which actual Energy Performance Certificate (“EPC”) data is not available.
```
```
The methodology is based on national regulatory frameworks, statistics and scenario analysis and is built
on the estimation of the EPC Letter of the building, fundamentals from which it is determined whether the
asset is energy inefficient by applying the criteria set by the RTS.
```
```
Buildings for which the project has been authorized after 31st December 2020 for construction and for which
no energy efficiency classification information is available, will be verified to be located in Member States
that have implemented from 2021 minimum energy performance requirements for new buildings aligned
with NZEB rules, as reported by BPIE – Building Performance Institute Europe in its document “Nearly Zero:
a review of EU Member State implementation of new build requirements”. Therefore, assets satisfying the
requirements are assumed to be energy efficient according to the RTS.
```
```
GRE SGR buildings constructed before 31st December 2020, for which EPC information is not always
available are located in Italy, France, Germany, Poland, Czech Republic and Spain. For these assets, the
EPC Letter corresponding to the energy efficiency class is attributed starting from the Primary Energy
Demand^4 value through criteria established or assumed by external references at national level, in particular:
```
- Italy – the energy-inefficiency threshold has been determined through a simulation on
    comparable buildings on the SIAPE database (Sistema Informativo sugli Attestati di Prestazione
    Energetica), the Italian national tool to collect the Energy Performance Certificates of buildings
    and real estate units as established by Interministerial Decree 26/06/ 2015.
- France – the energy-inefficiency threshold has been determined through a simulation on
    comparable buildings on the Observatoire DPE (Diagnostic de Performance Énergétique)
    Analyses Statistiques, the French national tool performing the database managed by the Agence
    De la Transition Écologique (ADEME) to collect the Energy Performance Certificates of buildings
    and real estate units.
- Germany, Poland, Czech Republic and Spain – the energy-inefficiency threshold has been
    determined as the PED belonging to the Top 15% (for each building’s intended use type) in terms
    of energy efficiency of the national real estate stock defined by the Real Estate ESG Index
    developed by Deepki.

```
Where the actual data on the Primary Energy Demand of the asset in the portfolio is not available, the actual
energy consumption intensity figure is adopted, assuming it as being comparable.
```
```
TABLE 2 – KPI 18: GHG emissions and KPI 19: Energy consumption intensity
```
- KPI 18 - Table 2 is calculated by applying to GHG emissions of the entire real estate asset an
    attribution factor based on the percentage of ownership of the building, in accordance with what
    defined for different asset classes by PCAF (Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials) in

(^4) The ‘Primary Energy Demand’ (PED) of a real estate asset is the amount of energy that must be generated originally in order to meet
the total energy demand of the building or real estate unit, equivalent to heating and cooling to maintain the desired temperature of the
building and the coverage of hot water demand. The calculation of the Primary Energy Demand takes place through a technical
assessment whose methodology is defined by the national regulatory framework transposing the EPBD (Energy Performance of Buildings
Directives).


```
the document PCAF Global GHG Standard^5. For investments in CRE debt, the attribution is
calculated as 'Project Loan-To-Value [%]' multiplied by 'GRE Fund ownership of the Loan [%]'.
```
- KPI 19 - Table 2 is calculated by dividing the real estate assets total energy consumption
    attributable to GRE by the sum of the Net Leasable Area attributable to GRE. The attribution
    factor, according to the same methodology as described previously, is based on the percentage
    of ownership of the building, in accordance with what defined for different asset classes by PCAF
    (Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials) in the “Global GHG Accounting & Reporting
    Standard for the Financial Industry”.
- Assets under construction, under refurbishment or vacant are considered as having no energy
    consumption and therefore the adverse impact does not materialize.
- For direct investments, data are extracted from a data analytics tool.
    The model inputs values from the same month of the previous year or the next closest month. If
    the coverage rate is insufficient to achieve an observation rate deemed appropriate, the missing
    energy consumption is estimated by extracting data from a benchmarking tool based on a model
    that considers asset characteristics such as area, country, primary use, and annual heating and
    cooling degree days. For CRE debt, data are directly collected from the Project Sponsor
    (representing ca. 5 % of the total portfolio). For indirect equity, which accounts for ca 5 % of the
    total portfolio, data are estimated through extrapolation of a sample of directly collected data from
    the Fund Managers.
- For assets for which the breakdown of Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions is not available
    and only the total GHG emissions data are available, the breakdown figures are estimated
    through an internal portfolio benchmark.
- GHG emissions and energy consumption of the assets in GRE SGR portfolio are accounted only
    for the period related to the days of detention during 2022.

```
Data source
In general, data sources and information for direct funds consist of direct observations and specific due
diligence. For indirect funds, the sources consist of the evidence from third-party asset managers. Further
information is available in the Methodology & approach for the PAIs calculation sub-paragraph “General
approach”.
```
```
Limitation to methodology
GRE SGR is aware of the margins of error that may arise due to the utilization of estimates in calculating
the PAIs "Exposure to energy-inefficient real estate assets", "GHG emissions" and "Energy consumption
intensity".
```
### Engagement policies

```
GRE SGR is proactive in reducing the environmental impact of the asset portfolio as well as integrating
environmental, social and governance (ESG) metrics and monitoring into the business operations.
```
```
The buildings sector consumes around 40% of the world’s energy and contributes up to 30% of global annual
greenhouse gas emissions. There is a high internal awareness and understanding that the real estate sector
is a key contributor to global trends such as climate change and that there is an opportunity for GRE to drive
large impact and demonstrate leadership within the market.
```
```
GRE SGR implemented and updated the “Sustainability Policy” and “Adverse Sustainability Impact
Statement”, publicly available on GRE’s website, that aims to describe the policies on the identification and
prioritisation of principal adverse sustainability impacts and indicators, the principal adverse sustainability
impacts and any action taken in relation thereto, the reference to GRE SGR adherence to responsible
business conduct codes and internationally recognized standards for due diligence and reporting and, where
relevant, the degree of GRE SGR alignment with the objectives of the Paris Agreement^6.
```
(^5) Document available at webcarbonaccountingfinancials.com
(^6) The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change to limit global warming to 1.5°C. It was adopted by 196
Parties at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris, France, on 12 December 2015. It entered into force on 4 November

2016. Futher information available at [http://www.unfccc.int](http://www.unfccc.int)


- GRE SGR, through GRE SPA, implements a wide range of ESG engagement actions to mitigate the
    PAIs considered in the previous section, in particular regarding tenants and counterparties:
    - Tenants: with Green Lease, GRE SGR undertakes the integration of the most important ESG topics
    into commercial leases in order to engage with tenants for a win-win sustainable collaboration, and
    to meet demand for data analytics and disclosure.
    - Investors: most of GRE SGR funds have implemented an ESG framework aimed at granting a
    sustainable allocation of capital into certified assets, in conjunction with a strong governance
    process, enhanced by a set of policies and processes able to further increase transparency, fairness
    and productivity. For example, the implementation of multiple risk management layers is granting
    sound monitoring capabilities, the development of cutting-edge data driven research adds objective
    and up-to-date ground to the underwriting phase, the robustness of a lean investment process
    ensures safe and fast execution. Social aspects are embedded in the asset management activities
    and typically depend on the peculiarities of the assets and of the communities in which it is located.

Among others, the implemented actions are also aiming at mitigating the “Exposure to fossil fuels through
real estate assets” and “Exposure to energy-inefficient real estate assets" PAIs.

In the long term, if engagement activities are not deemed adequate in relation to PAIs, corrective measures
will be provided on a case-by-case basis.

In carrying out the engagement activities with the tenants, GRE collects and monitors periodically all the
data required to compute the indicators for representing the impacts. This allows us to act purposefully in
the case of observation of no reduction of the principal adverse impacts over more than one period reported
on.

With specific reference to the real estate sector, it should be noted that the effectiveness of data monitoring
is subject to limited capacity in terms of resources and data systems dedicated to the sustainability
information management.

Furthermore, it is proper to mention that, due to the peculiarity of the real estate sector, GHG emissions and
energy consumption annual data are strictly related to building occupancy, tenants’ habits and climate-
atmospheric patterns and temperature trends by geographical area, and this may lead to a limitation of time
series comparability.

### References to international standards

The Generali Group Strategy on Climate Change is a key reference point for GRE SGR, and it provides an
overview of the decisions taken to promote a fair and socially just transition to a net-zero emission economy,
in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement, the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance and the Net-Zero
Insurance Alliance.
GRE SGR commitment to continuous improvement in both real estate transactions and within the industry
is highlighted in the support, as part of the Generali Group, of the following international initiatives:

In carrying out its analyses, GRE SGR applies the scenario methodology developed by the Carbon Risk
Real Estate Monitor (“CRREM”) provides the real estate industry with transparent, science-based
decarbonization pathways that are aligned with the Paris Climate Goals of limiting global temperature
increase to 2°C, with an ambition to reach 1.5°C. CRREM offers a comprehensive framework focused on
carbon risk exposure and potential strategies to reduce this risk, and includes the elements needed to
undertake scenario analysis.
